# Styleio - reinventing the way people shop for interior design
## Styleio backend web service

Open sourcing my "failed" project/startup. For anyone to look at or use. 

Source code is messy because it was one of my first projects in programming that evolved for a couple of years. 

A service wrapping the database which contains the wallpaper information. Unfortunately missing the schema of the database, but might be diffused from the code.
